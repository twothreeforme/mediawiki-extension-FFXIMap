This is a HorizonXI exclusive extension that adds an interactive FFXI map with the `<FFXIMap>` tag. 

This is an interactive map for FFXI. This extension is designed specifically to work with the HorizonXI Wiki (https://horizonffxi.wiki/), and is built using the Leaflet library (https://leafletjs.com/). 

The project was started to give players a more intuitive FFXI map tool. Basic functionality includes displaying a zone map (ie: Upper Jeuno) in a custom sized window, zoom controls, and clickable links for all zone connections. Advanced functionality includes displaying pulsating icons on the map for user defined things, for instance NPCs in a city or Treasure Coffers in a zone. The advanced functions work in a local testing environment and are currently being migrated to the Wiki for editors to evaluate.
